# Daisy

Daisy is a custom language for a Static Site Generator.

What does it look like? Check [my website](https://github.com/meir/website)

# How to start

An example repository has been made [here](https://github.com/meir/website/tree/example) which will automatically build the website using github actions, direnv and nix flakes.
Only change needed is currently in the .github/workflows/build.yaml to change the domain, this will be gone eventually.
